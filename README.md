## What the hell is Socculi?

[Socculi](https://socculi.com) (currently a work-in-progress) is a simple fantasy league based on English Premier League. It's a small passion project that I started in my free time; because apart from my love for the English Premier League, I love creating interesting stuff (relatively speaking!), and to create myself an opportunity to improve my skills in React, Redux, and Wordpress.

Football-data.org is a free service that provides football data and statistics (live scores, fixtures, tables, squads, lineups/subs, etc.) in a machine-readable way.

Socculi is powered by React/Vite on the frontend, and MySQL and Wordpress on the backend. It's currently using Auth0 for authentication.
